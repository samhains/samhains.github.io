I was hired by the [Barnes Foundation](https://www.barnesfoundation.org/) to do research and development into using artificial intelligence technology to for their [new Collections website](https://collection.barnesfoundation.org/). Specifically, my task was to use machine learning technologies to generate meta-data across their art collection to assist in building their curation tools.  

Shelley Bernstein, of the Barnes foundation, wrote[ a blog post](https://medium.com/barnes-foundation/using-computer-vision-to-tag-the-collection-f467c4541034) detailing some of the work.  
I developed a custom machine (deep) learning model that performs image detection for multiple classes in paintings and artworks. Below are some examples of the custom models results.
