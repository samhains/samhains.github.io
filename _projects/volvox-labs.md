Worked with [Volvox Labs](http://volvoxlabs.com) to provide VFX content for a moving image commission for NYLON Beauty Innovator Awards. The content was designed for an 'immersive 360-dome projection experience' called [The Pore](http://volvoxlabs.com/nylon-dome-content/) which invited guests to experience how extreme temperatures, wind, dirt and pollution make us feel.

Content was simulated and rendered in Houdini.

In addition to working on the design team, I worked alongside Technical Lead at Volvox - Xavier Cruz, to projection map the exterior of the dome.
