*Jack and Samâ€™s eDream Portal* is triptych of [real-time video simulations](http://iancheng.com/faq) about the search for the human and the authentic within a simulated world. The piece stars Jack and Jill, the first computer graphics surrogate humans and Sam, the author, as himself. Equal parts Hieronymous Bosch and factory logistics software, eDream Portal creates a mythology around the Adam and Eve of the corporate simulation.

The story of this installation is told in more detail through my NYU ITP thesis talk.
