"Jack and Sam's eDream portal" is a triptych of [real-time video simulations](http://iancheng.com/faq) inspired by Boschâ€™s "The Garden of Earthly Delights".  The installation replaces Adam and Eve from the Christian creation tryptic with Jack and Jill, the first citizens of [the corporate simulation](https://flexsim.com).  The appropriation of this material provided a way of engaging with the world making capabilities of computer systems through falsified mythology.

The story of this installation is told in more detail through my NYU ITP thesis talk.
