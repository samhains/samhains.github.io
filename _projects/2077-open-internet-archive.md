2077: Open Internet Archive is an interactive art installation set in a possible future where the internet has been reduced to an archive in a pile of trash. The piece is an interface for a speculative internet - a possible outcome from the corporatisation of online space.

On encountering the installation, the participant sees a ringing telephone. The voice on the telephone explains the internet is now an archive maintained by volunteers. The user has two options, they may search the archive by voice or request for more information about the system they are interacting with.

From a technical standpoint, the installation involves a modified rotary dial telephone, a Touch Designer server for the visuals, projection mapping and interaction, and an additional a python server performing voice recognition and data collection.
