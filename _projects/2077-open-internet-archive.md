2077: Open Internet Archive is an interactive art installation set in the year 2077 where internet has been reduced to an archive in a pile of trash.

The piece allows the participant to interact with a speculative internet, as well as learn the story surrounding this possible future.

On entering the space, the participant encounters a ringing telephone. The voice on the telephone explains that this installation is the last of what remains of the internet, given that it has been abandoned and is no longer profitable to maintain. The user has the option of either exploring the archives by voice, or hearing more information about the circumstances that lead to the demise of the free internet. The script for the phone interaction can be read <a href="http://samhains.com/2077_telephone_script.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

It is the year 2077 and the 'free web' has been depreciated and discarded like an old pile of junk. An open source, radical political group maintains a public archive that can be accessed via telephone. In this sad future - a broken, anachronistic interface is all that is available for the user to experience what was once known as the 'free internet'.
