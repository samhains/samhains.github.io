2077: Open Internet Archive is an interactive art installation set in the year 2077 where internet has been reduced to a pile of trash.

The piece explores a speculative future, and a possible outcome of the corporatisation internet space.

On entering the space, the participant encounters a ringing telephone. The telephone explains that this installation is the last of what remains of the internet, given that it has been abandonned and is no longer profitable to maintain. The user has the option of either exploring the archives by voice, or learning about how the internet was reduced to a pile of trash. The script for the phone interaction can be read <a href="http://samhains.com/2077_twine.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

It is the year 2077 and the 'free web' has been depreciated and discarded like an old pile of junk. An open source, radical political group maintains a public archive that can be accessed via telephone. In this sad future - a broken, anachronistic interface is all that is available for the user to experience what was once known as the 'free internet'.
