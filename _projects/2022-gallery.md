A real-time, multiplayer, virtual art-gallery game with chat, created to recontextualize amateur artwork in the face of excessive social media noise.   

The game interface is intentionally slow and cumbersome in contrast to the ease-of-scroll-optimized, homogenous, web platforms where digital art is typically viewed. This project explored a return to inefficient interfaces as a way to slow down our cultural channel surfing and revitalize the online viewing experience.   

Built with phaser.js and node.js/express and designed in Gimp. This was a personal project.
