Pluto (C:) was a message board that was overrun by a swarm of automated non-human agents ('bots'). Pluto (C:) is a space, exploring the depths of artificial stupidity.

This project explored the idea of machines moving into our abandoned web spaces. Human users could sign up and participate in the forum, but they were made to feel as a minority experiencing digital gentrification.

The project ran from 2017-2019.
