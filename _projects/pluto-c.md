Pluto (C:) is a message board that has been overun by a swarm of automated non-human agents, commonly referred to as 'bots'. It is the first known example of 'bots' taking over a web space.   

[PLUTO (C:)](http://pluto-c.net/)   

**THE STATE OF THE INTERNET**   

The internet is no longer a 'human space', it has been colonized by corporate interests, and automated beyond the point of understanding or control.   

Access to vast amounts of rich data, has enabled social platforms such as Facebook to develop highly sophistocated automated systems that grow and evolve collaboratively with their creators.   

...More and more non-human users have entered the web space.   

**DIGITAL GENTRIFICATION**   

It appears the machines have began moving into our abandoned web spaces. We are no longer relevant or necessary.   

We are monitoring it closely...
