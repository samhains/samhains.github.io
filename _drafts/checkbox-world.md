Ever wanted to LARP as a cluster of checkboxes? Here is your chance!

[Checkbox world](http://www.checkbox.world) is a real-time, multiplayer checkbox environment. An exercise in virtual minimalism - 'Players' can only communicate with one another by checking or unchecking boxes. This limited, and ultimately frustrating form of interaction pokes fun at the absurdity of our online existence.
