**Background**

My high school experience was highly structured and goal-oriented. The school reinforced dominant doctrines with regard to gender, sexuality and culture. In many ways it was a toxic, patriarchal environment. Based on aptitude testing, I was categorized as a 'logical type', and was not encouraged to participate in the arts. It was not only essential, but encouraged to subordinate ones inner world. The pursuit of memorizing the exploits of a broken educational system.  I qualified for a prestigious degree -  lost and without passion. Unfortunately, I feel I am still unlearning this experience.


**Teaching Philosophy**

Social Learning by working together, sharing experience and understanding. Self determined needs and outcomes.  Multiplicity and plurality. A 'living curriculum' where we can generate and negotiate  our own knowledge. embrace open ended nature of knowledge.

Preconceived ideas about gender, sexuality lead to toxic behaviours. Diversity in content and material. Reality is real and socially constructed, there are ways to interfere with this reality in both semantics and intervention. Reaction to the canon. Teacher as a window.

Philosophy: Learning is meaningful not from abstract universals and truths, but through experimentation. Each field of inquiry is an 'object of encounter', all concepts can be made, remade and remixed.

The school does not believe in categorizing students or pigeoning holing them into particular categories. Barriers between left and right brain are ficticious. Aptitude is de-emphasized, passion and curiosity is rewarded.

Students are encouraged to explore, but not expected to.  Structure is helpful, and can relieve the burden of choice. However the structure is always radically composable.

Finding a balance between structure and unstructure is a fundamental challenge to this approach.

Curriculum reflects the interconnectedness of all ideas in the experienced world.

**Learning Objective**

Open-minded students, who are critical, creative and accepting. Students are capable of compassion, care, empathy.

A natural instinct for questioning preconceived notions of reality. More community oriented, people.

**Learning Outcome**

Students who are able to critically evaluate their prejudices, are compassionate and accepting towards others. Are strong problem solvers, creative.

Demonstrable understanding of various fields of knowledge, and how they are interconnected with other fields. An enhanced ability to express ones self, introspect and perform. Greater curiosity.

Students should be capable community builders and contributers in the context of virtual communities and contemporary information technologies.

**Curriculum as Sandbox Intranet**

There will be no discrete classrooms, instead a large open space with freedom of movement.

The curriculum is delivered through a compose-able virtual space that is developed maintained by students and teachers. Each area of study is a virtual community space with an initial state and function of something like a Wiki. However unlike a Wiki, the structure, rules and concept of the space may be radically overhauled through collaborative intervention on behalf of Students and Teachers, if this is the desire of the class. Some classes will be more active in exploring the possibilities of evolving environment, whereas others will benefit from more structure.  Over the year the space comes to represent the nature of the shared knowledge and understanding that has been developed.

The sandbox internet contains other preliminary features to assist with pedagogy. For example, some communities will participate in simulated environments, such as a simulated financial system in which all students will be assigned a particular role. This financial system simulation.

* Teacher as a window. A model for an existing learning community.
* The logic of the hyperlink. Teachers point students to particular knowledge discovered through discussion and inquiry.

In order to encourage the development. The school internet is controlled and many social networks such as Facebook and Instagram are blocked. Students will be encouraged to incorporate methods of virtual encounter and collaboration into the fabric of the community system itself.
