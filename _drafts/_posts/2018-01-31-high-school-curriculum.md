* Community as the curriculum.
* There are no discrete classrooms, rather open spaces which are populated by students and Teachers.
* Each subject is a defined by the presence of an online  'community' space which exists as a smaller part of a larger 'network'.
* Students are members of several 'communities' depending on their interests. Students will act as core members in some, engaging more extensively, while more casual in others.
* Contents for each area of study are more 'building blocks' and 'starting points' for collaborative development of the learning platform.
* these communities are ecosystems which each person is spreading their understanding, and publically making ones way through the process through content creation, collaboration and sharing.
* Platform as Community, to some degrere self-governed. premised on self-determined needs and outcomes.
* Objectives do not pre-exist student involvement.
* Hacking and creating new combinations of information and technology encouraged.
* Students will build their own learning and communication platforms.
* Social Learning - learning by working together, sharing experience, and understanding.
* A reaction to the canon - experts are no longer arbiters of 'verified information'.
* A living curriculum - generate and negotiate their own knowledge.
* Embrace open ended nature of knowledge.
* 'detachable, connectible, reversible, modifiable - multiple entryways and exits'.
* Constructed and negotiated in real time by those engaged in process.
Flexibility is essential.
* Teacher as a window. A model for an existing learning community.
* The logic of the hyperlink. Teachers point students to particular knowledge discovered through discussion and inquiry.
* Self-determined pathways - familiar to learners in digital age
* Lack of center measurement about what is "true" or "right" - knowledge created by broad collection of knowers sharing in the construction and ongoing evaluation of each given field.
* The canon is abandoned in favour of a more diverse range of representation.
* Communities will center around a collection of co-existent and overlapping ideas, but each community will overlap with other communities.
* Learning from experience, experiments with the world
* The making and remaking of ideas constitus creative process.
* Reality is both real and socially constructed, there are ways to interfere with this reality in both semantic shifts and physical intervention.
* The schools internet is highly controlled, many social networks such as Facebook and Instagram are blocked to encourage students to build their own collaborative and communication platforms.
* Religion is reduced into the building blocks for a collaboratively defined spritual and philsophical practice that will be developed as the year progresses.

All Communities:
  * will encourage performance, artistic expression and poetry.
  * will be working with students to develop creative thinking, self confidence and inter-dependence and purpose.
  * will prescribe a variety of base texts that are linked by conceptual themes.
  * will foster creative thinking, self-confidence and a broader sense of community purpose
  * will encourage students to explore their curiosity
  * will combine rigorous, rational process with performance, artistic expression and spontaneity.
  * will promote egalitarian values

Philosophy: Learning is meaningful not from abstract universals and truths, but through experimentation. Each field of inquiry is an 'object of encounter', all concepts can be made, remade and remixed.

The school does not believe in categorizing students or pigeoning holing them into particular categories. Barriers between left and right brain are ficticious. Aptitude is de-emphasized, passion and curiosity is rewarded.
