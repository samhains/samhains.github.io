Interactivity defines a relationship between two actors, whereby both actors
play a role in determining system outcomes.  There must be some degree of indeterminacy
embraced by the system in order for it to produce an interactive experience.
For example, A users journey through a website interface is
indeterminate in terms of when or where or how the interaction will occur. The
interaction, once it happens, will cause the program to respond, and change the
state of the relationship.  Interactivity is this result of a system which is
capable of resolving indeterminate factors in a relationship between two actors.
