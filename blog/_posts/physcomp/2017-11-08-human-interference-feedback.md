After demonstrating a basic 'play' version of my proposed visual sculpture, I received some helpful feedback.

I will attempt to summarise my impression of the feedback here:

Firstly, the transition from 'No interference' to 'Full interference' is not dramatic enough. We move from one form of disorientation to another, contrast is lacking.

One solution to this would be to play with 'off states' and 'static' images. Several of the monitors might be off unless somebody is nearby. When they turn on they might 'grab' an image and come to life as a gradual process which builds as the user approaches. I plan to start playing with tensions between the projected and the static.

Somebody mentioned that the project seemed like it was about to reveal to the participant their greatest fears. This reminded me of Andrei Tarkovsky's film [Stalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalker_(1979_film) where the 'Zone' was a space that one might enter to communicate with a mysterious 'other' intelligence. It was ambiguous what the nature of the communication was, but it seemed to cause an existential fissure for those that ventured there. This is worth keeping in mind for further concept development - perhaps it is time to read the original  novel that the film is based on [Roadside Picnic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadside_Picnic).

A general criticism was that the interactivity needs to be developed to make the concept of 'communicating with the machine' clearer and more purposeful.

One potential solution to this would be to incorporate a Kinect sensor which would incorporate user movement data into the projections in various ways.

Others mentioned that it would be nice to be able to 'touch' the screen, which is something that I would also like to explore.

Mike Sherwood and Mike Allison's [Firewall](http://aaron-sherwood.com/works/firewall/)  is a worthy reference for its use of stretched spandex sheets and rear projection mapping to create an interactive surface.

This type of interaction could be a great fit for my project, however I imagine that it might be difficult to cleanly communicate to the users that they should 'touch' the monitors.

There was a positive feedback with respect to the custom fabricated projection screens. However, the front projection technique restricts straight-forward interaction.

One idea might be to use light sensors with front projection surfaces. The computer will be notified when the projection is being interrupted. This could trigger another interaction or be countered by a rear projection.

 I plan to continue prototyping projection surfaces and screen options that could be used for the installation.
