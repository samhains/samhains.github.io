This project is interactive visual sculpture. The project explores ideas and tropes surrounding human-machine communication through an interactive, fictional call center. The call center connects the participant to an accelerated diagram of our existing reality, loosely based on Nick Land's science fiction poem 'Meltdown'.


The visuals contain a representation of a potential future where people have retreated from complexity into performance, role playing, virtual worlds.
