This project is an interactive visual sculpture which explores ideas and tropes surrounding human-machine communication. We tend to anthropomorphise our contact with artificial intelligence; smiling human avatars, or home electronics that transform into terminators. This project considers the space that exists between Human and Machine when we take away the human facade.

How do we really communicate with the machine?

Through the use of audio-visual feedback loops, found footage from the edges of a complexified online culture and repurposed e-waste- I attempt to explore the emptiness of the machine ‘intelligence’ and the terrifying, distorted image of humanity which it reflects.
