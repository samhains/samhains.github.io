Human Interference is a work in in progress that will take the form of an interactive art installation driven by 'video content'. The piece looks to explore the experience of making contact with another intelligence.

The inspiration for this piece struck me when browsing artist and educator [Gregory Shaw's website](http://moodvector.com).

My immediate reaction to this image was that the computers were looking in my direction - curious about me. Despite the colours, and the playful interface I sense something sinister lurking under the surface.

'Human Interference' is the working title for a project that wishes to draw into this sinister space, only to have the participant realize that the floor falls and the truth is an existential threat.

The content will be displayed on old computer monitors and driven by Touch Designer and Max MSP. Depth sensors determine whether the participant is inside or outside the machine space.  

**IN CONSIDERATION**

* Other lazer switches may be set up to trigger lighting, sound and video effects.
*  Kinect data to increase interactivity with screen display.

The interaction for the project involves some kind of 'hook' which brings the participant into the 'machine space'. The space will emanate a simple allure that deceives the participant.

**POSSIBILITIES FOR LURE**
* Ambient music
* Simple, bold colours

As the user approaches the space, we can see from the screens that the human is creating some kind of disturbance in the machine world. Feedback loops will create a sense of disorientation.

As they enter the space, we see a destruction of familiar forms, and the user is bombarded with industrial, cold, electrical sounds.

I did some white boarding to try and clarify some ideas.

The first idea was deep-diving into the science-fiction context to this installation. [Nick Land's Meltdown](ccru.net/swarm1/1_melt.htm) short piece of speculative, science fiction was an inspiration. Each monitor contains a different fragment of the context of imagined world. We have human slaves, a human vision config, automated trading platforms, 'neural interfaces' and empty e-sports arenas.

An imagined science-fiction universe remains important for my idea generation process, however I found this literal representation to be lacking in subtlety.

Some more minimal options including computer communication through voice chat and LED's to signify machine to machine communication .

I started experimenting with Touch Designer and GLSL shaders to explore feedback effects. The feedback expresses a recursive void which I felt fit in naturally with my concept.

I am pleased with these results, however it needs to be taken further. To make this scarier, audio is very important.

I built some projection mapping surfaces to allow for some more high fidelity prototyping of the aesthetic.

Prototyping illustrated the need for more varied content, effects and interactive development.
