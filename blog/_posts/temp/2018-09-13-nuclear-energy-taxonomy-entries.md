**GAME IDEAS**
Page one involves an illustration of the environment, and the overview of the setting and rules.
Page two includes tables that are referenced on page one to generate different events and add variance to the encounters described on page one.

* Play as radio active stray dogs that are tracking the areas around Chernobyl
* Play as radio active insect that are tracking the areas around a low-level radiation plant. Post apocalypse of the insect world.
* Zoom in and out of the microscope
* Human lead expedition into nuclear affected megastructure research complex
* Lewis Carroll meets Fallout inspired world?

**RESEARCH**
* The work of Arvind Rajagopal (Cold War Media) to develop ideas around cold war aesthetics and media culture.
* Electricity surge caused Chernobyl releasing radioactive hot lava
* Created hot radioactive waste in the shape of medusa
* Radioactive zone
* Dogs (Wolf?) of Chernobyl tracking radiation they are able to enter zone.
* Ants of Chernobyl, tracking the low level effects that radiation has on microscopic level.
* Hesse Honegger's [illustrations of insect mutations](http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/25/Hesse-Honegger.php) show the effects on insects from low-level radiation from Swiss nuclear plants as well as from Chernobyl.
* Bunnies & Burrows is a RPG played as [rabbits](https://img.5plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1367/58/1367589918750.pdf).
* Dr. Timothy Mousseau shows large and significant genetic consequences to radiation.
* Children in-utero
* Trees grow in strange shapes
* Firebug
* cuckhoo song has changed
* Many fewer animals in radioactive spots
* Every rock you turn over shows impact of radio contamination

*"Through this research in the field, as well as through the act of describing these deformities through the pictorial process, I can show that “low-level radiation” emitted from even the best-maintained nuclear plants is in fact extremely dangerous to nature and, thus, also to human beings. In part, what has allowed us to ignore these facts is that we are incapable of seeing the damage."*

* Hundreds of stray dogs have learned to survive in the woods around the exclusion zone – mainly descendants of those left behind after the nuclear disaster, when residents were banned from taking their beloved pets to safety*
