This week was a deep dive on heterotopias, utopias, dystopias and megastructures as a means of representing ideology in art.

The biggest breakthrough came in the discovery of Rem Koohaas' graduate thesis - The Exodus, or the voluntary prisoners of architecture.  The Exodus is an ideological city – a counter cultural, speculative place that is at odds with the globalising, standardising forces of the 'outside'. It is a voluntary prison that resists the emergent culture of its time. By inverting the role of a prison, he created a site for an upheaval of normative society where the wretched is glorified and norms are inverted.  The prison becomes the 'free zone'. A melting of existential space with ideology.

This project, in the words of Koolhaas, is a proposition that requires 'a fundamental belief in cities as the incubators of social desires, the synthetic materialization of all dreams'.

However, I propose that this has shifted towards networks and cybernetic systems as the incubators of desire. Which brings me to the question -  what would a software architecture against the capitalist surveillance economy look like?

# A No Like Zone

A piece of software disconnected from the newly forming global megastructure.  A means of revealing, satirically the current state of affairs. A digital space in opposition to the singularity of individualism but also the fatigue of it.  In opposition to innovation culture, creative rule breaking and relativism. In opposition to the corporatized rhizome of literalized 1960s postmodernism and its content sharing tools and networks. In opposition to the development of unique 'subjectivity' only to mine these subjects for data points. In oppositions to hashtags and corporate green washing. In opposition to efficiency. In opposition to quality content. This is a No Like Zone. This software architecture has no concept of the surveillance mechanisms, no drag nets, no google play areas and no apple stores or innovation hubs.

The structure of Exodus may be instructive here.  Koolhaas describes 10 square zones – all of them are programmed spaces where people exist in a narrative beyond the capitalist apparatus. Each zone carries some kind of character in opposition to symbolic connotations of globalising forces which are the 'outside' to this inverted 'inside'.

An example from his 'Park of Four Elements':
*"Identical in size to the first square but sunken below surface level is "Desert," an artificial reconstruction of an Egyptian landscape, simulating its dizzying conditions: a pyramid, a small oasis, and the fire organ — a steel frame with innumerable outlets for flames of different intensity, color, and heat. It is played at night to provide a pyrotechnic spectacle visible from all parts of the Strip, a nocturnal sun.

At the end of tour linear caves, mirage machines project images of desirable ideals. Those in the Desert who enter the tubes run to reach these beatific images. But actual contact can never be established: they run on a belt that moves in the opposite direction at a speed that increases as the distance between mirage and runner shrinks. The frustrated energies and desires will have to be channeled into sublimated activities”

Side note:  These modernist, utopian architectural projects from the 60s and 70s bare a striking resemblance to the design of roleplaying worlds for Dungeons and Dragons (and related games). This connection is something that I might explore in the implementation.*

Questions I need to develop: What is the opposition to the symbolic connotations of our current  capitalist surveillance economy? What is the new outside?

I do not propose a rejection of software, but a detouring or reimagining.

Since Koolhaas, the meaning of an 'outside' of a capitalism has shifted. The digital labyrinth cultivated by platform economies has its own totalizing character. It feeds off specificity of subjects, and encourages us to share thoughts, feelings and desires for its functioning.  It needs 'rich' datasets from its citizens. It will create interfaces for this expression where people don't feel inhibited. It will offer an increasingly hyper-individualized, irresistible content vortex for us to inside. Irreverence, rule-breaking, resistance and organizational practice are all recorded, documented and amalgamated. The political reality is being eroded.
