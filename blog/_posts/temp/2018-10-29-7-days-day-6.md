**7 ZONES OF THE NO LIKES ZONE**

![](/assets/7days/6.png)
_The Firewall ('The Wall') that surrounds the Zone is the mechanism through which prisoners achieve both voluntary imprisonment and freedom. It creates an enclosure, a sanctuary in which the Zone can provide its cohesive, controlled experience. It offers a retreat from visibility. Total security and protection. Many prisoners develop bonds with 'The Wall'.  It is a 'Heartbreakingly Beautiful' technology of sacred importance._
