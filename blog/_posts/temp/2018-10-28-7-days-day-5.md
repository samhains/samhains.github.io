**7 ZONES OF THE NO LIKES ZONE**

![](/assets/7days/5.png)
_No Likes Zone, Welcome Screen.  After crossing the Wall, an inmate is received by an attentive receptionist who assists in customizing the initiation program for each person._

_The tropical atmospherics of the Welcome Screen soothe the fatigued inmate before the initiation rituals.  Inmates are always undernourished.  Senses will be adjusted, and desires will be relinquished before proceeding to the Central Interface._
