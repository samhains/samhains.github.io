# How do deeply immersive digital spaces infect the real world?

Problem: Weaponized neuroscience and the exploitation of desire. The growing power of Cybernetic control systems.

The contemporary subject is compelled by desire. Creatively break the rules. Revive the game with creative rule breaking. Ubiquitous entertainment and economic struggle. Radical entrepreneurialism in a Google Play Space. Smile and innovate. Desire machine. Deleuze and desire machines. Where is the outside in this? How do we maintain our sense of who we are when the Platform determines us. Foucault suggested we would become more and more alienated - but the truth is scarier in an era of weaponized desire. There is no outside - not even our own desires. How are bodies coded and decoded in  this space? (Hall).

How to provide insight into this new form of de-alienated control?

# Why am I drawn to procedural generation and the medium of the Simulation to explore this?

John Gerrard's argument for the Simulation. Simulation book.
Ian Chengs argument for the Simulation.
Game Designers Jason Grinblat argument for use of Simulation (Caves of Qud)

John Gerrard - "People look at them and think to themselves, there is something wrong. A slight sense of disorientation. They know that something is wrong but they can't put their finger on it. No lens based record. A real place remade as a virtual world. In opposition to the fictions of gaming. Must be powered to exist. Commercial gaming, portraits of real places. Often stranger than fictions. Cinema has a duration. This medium doesn't have a duration. Whatever it takes as its subject becomes post-human.  The record of the scene is a memory of it. Video can no longer be considered experimental. Cultural production integrates software in a significant sense. Real physical infrastructures and technologies that influence culture"

Ian Cheng - "Never has a begin and end. Ongoing like life is ongoing. Simulation is a video game that plays itself. Being and middle and end has limits to describing the behaviour of a character. Consciousness was a way to project yourself forwards in time or backwards in time in order to resolve your stress. Inspired by book called Impro - British improvisational theatre. A safe space to recolonize the right side of the brain. The part of the brain that gets taken away when we try and form a factual understanding of the world. Improv is the scaffolding or the portal to get you back to the non-anxious, present, childlike state of dreams. Model of the mind with different ways of being. Portal to tolerating uncertainty, ambiguity and weirdness. Surf the weirdness."

Jason Grinblat - "Emergent narratives are also authentic. In resulting from the collision of systems rather than the script of an author, they mirror the experiences we have in our everyday lives, the stories we hear from our family and friends, and the tales we read about in history books. videogames open a new domain for persuasion, thanks to their core representational mode, procedurality.'2 He calls this domain procedural rhetoric, 'the art of persuasion through rule-based representations and interactions rather than the spoken word, writing, images, or moving pictures.'"


Go to a site. Photograph it. Model it. Relationship between real and virtual. What is a site of desire.

Theory of change is to recolonize the right-side brain.


Topic of your choosing that
- identifies a problem, to which your design is a relevant response (the problem can be grounded in  / focused on a subject that is  historical, political, social, physical, biological, climatological, economic etc)
- starts with a question
- requires a consideration of media, audience, and outcomes (theory of change)
Engages actively with a public (participation, feedback, co-creation)
