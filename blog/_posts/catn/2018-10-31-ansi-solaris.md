To get inspiration I did some natural language processing on the 1972 science fiction film 'Solaris' by Tarkovsky which I watched recently in fever-state and I can't stop thinking about it.

Time is barely mentioned. Almost variation in place and people. Lots of X-rays and oceans.

So I decided to create an ANSI simulation of an ocean under siege from X-rays.  Makes me want to explore more Dwarf-fortress inspired text-simulations.
