To get inspiration I did some natural language processing on the English translated script for the 1972 science fiction film 'Solaris' by Tarkovsky.  I watched it recently in fever-state and I can't stop thinking about.

Time is barely mentioned. Very little variation in place and persons mentioned. Lots of X-rays and oceans.

I made an ANSI simulation of an ocean under siege from X-rays. While this was very much just a 'sketch', it has opened up the idea of further experimentation with non-playable, simulated, ANSI environments (Dwarf Fortress).
