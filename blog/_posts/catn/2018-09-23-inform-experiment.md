For this task I adopted a scene from Lewis Carroll's "Through The Looking Glass" called "Garden of Live Flowers".  Beware vampiric Heart Queen!

I found this task to be interesting, and I got a lot out of engaging with this medium. Inform is an idiosyncratic and strange enough tool that one week didn't feel like enough time for me to get *really* into the narrative modelling/creative aspect of this task. But, I started getting the hang of it and I'm into it as a tool - for sure! Making me curious about playing around with some kind of MUDs style narrative adventure for final. Hhmmm!
