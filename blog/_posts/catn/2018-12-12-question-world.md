Continuing my pre-thesis explorations of simulations as the site of contact between machine and human worlds - I created a typographic experiment based on [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/).

I wrote a python script that allowed me to deconstruct and reconstruct bitmaps into new arrangements. The code for that is [here](https://github.com/samhains/bitmap-font-maker).

This computational approach allowed me to experiment with different typographical representations to feed to the Dwarf Fortress simulation, which would otherwise be a very time consuming photoshop task of lining up pixels.

Here is a sample of some of the bitmap fonts that I created:

My favourite font I created was the "?" font, which makes explicit the already confusing nature of the Dwarf Fortress simulation.

Here is a 10 minute video, following a ? through a simulated world of ?'s.
