This was a really fun task. I experimented with [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/), a procedural node-based language to do this task. It felt very suitable. I was just experimenting blindly, but this process of creating typography computationally is exciting. I think I would use this technique for creating languages in imagined worlds. I'd also love to return to this and start by trying and recreate some of [my favourite graphic designers work](https://davidrudnick.org/).

This is what my houdini network looks like:

(The barcode language is a rendering of a version of the network but only about half way through)
