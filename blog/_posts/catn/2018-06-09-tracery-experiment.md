For this task I decided to deconstruct the plot of Italian, supernatural Giallo film [Suspiria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspiria) as a shell for generative narrative.

I spent most of my time, analysing and deconstructing this narrative into abstractions inspired by [Propp's Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Propp#Functions). The abstractions that I finished with were:

*Arrival* - hero arrives at the site horror, and is met by someone who has seen the horror.<br>
*Seeks Refuge* - hero seeks refuge<br>
*Horror Foreshadowed* - the person who has seen the horror, foreshadows what they are seen<br>
*Horror aware victim murdered* - the person who has seen the horror is murdered (in an ornate and ridiculous fashion)<br>
*Introduced to killer* - the hero is introduced to the killer and their accomplices(they do not realize they are the killer)<br>
*Supernatural event* - a strange supernatural event occurs but is quickly rationalized<br>
*Strange killer behaviour* - the hero notices some strange behaviour from the killer<br>
*Ally murdered* - one of the heroes allies are murdered<br>
*Ally Strangeness* - there was some strange and unusual behaviour surrounding the ally<br>
*Ally investigation* - the hero investigates the allies death which leads to the truth about the murderer (supernatural)<br>
*final showdown* - the murderer ventures into the murderers lair where they are slain<br>
*End* - the hero leaves the site of the horror physically unharmed, and it burns to the ground behind them<br>


Definitely found myself getting very lost in the weeds of trying to generate a non-trivial narrative. There was not a lot of variation in the discourse, and I'm not sure that I managed to get beyond a kind of complex 'world replacement' technique. I'd like to look a bit more closely at Propp's work and return to this task (perhaps using a different tool).
