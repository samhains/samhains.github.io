This week I began the experiment in Unity in the hope that I could integrate some of these computational typography experiments into another project that I'm working on. This was probably not the best move for productivity and output. I ran out of time to implement what I had in mind. Next assignment I will stick to the script.

The letters 's-i-m-u-l-a-t-i-o-n' are spelled out by a group of simulated agents in unity. However, it is not such a successful experiment as this is not clear, nor is the 'logic of the simulation' that might be in dialogue with the letters.
