This week I did some pure experimentation and play with p5.js and the examples sketches that Allison provided.

I'm not exactly proud of the outcome, but there were some interesting moments.  It ended up in a very chaotic place. The simpler moments that I had earlier on in experimentation were more interesting and I regret not creating a save file at that point in the progress! If I was to proceed with this approach, I think I'd just export out a new font and do the layout manually.
