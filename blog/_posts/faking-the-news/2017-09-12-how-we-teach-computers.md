I took this [TED Talk - How computers understand
pictures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40riCqvRoMs) from Youtube and split it into frames.
I then took the frames and ran them through [Google's Im2Txt algorithm](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/im2txt), to
generate captions. I took this text and used it to create a supercut of the
original video.

This experiment looks at techniques for producing video aesthetics that reflect the understanding of AI systems.

Here is an excerpt from the video:
