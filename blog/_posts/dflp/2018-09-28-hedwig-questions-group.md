**One Simple Sentence**<br>
Hedwig and the Angry Inch is about a painful quest for wholeness.

**One Complex Sentence**<br>
Hedwig And The Angry Inch is about repairing the sense of self which fractures in the face of trauma.

**Three to Five Sentence version of the story**<br>
Hedwig and the Angry Inch is about a genderqueer rock musician retelling the story of her life on stage. She relives the pain of trying to find completeness through the conditional love of others: an emotionally absent mother, a botched sex change operation, and the betrayal of her musician protege. We are left with a vision of an individual overcoming of the painful divisions in her self to become whole.
