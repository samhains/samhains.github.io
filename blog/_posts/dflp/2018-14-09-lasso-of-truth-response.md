**Three to Five Sentence version of the story**
Inventor and wife engage in kinky play that sublimates the man, although it seems this is primarily for his pleasure - a reversal of sexual power binary. When the Amazon is brought into their relationship the trio begin a polygamous exploration and seek to redefine the possibilities of what a relationship could be.
