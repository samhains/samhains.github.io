**Fuchs world questions**<br>
This story is told from a dream that overlooks a planet of plain surburban interiors - malls, family bedrooms, event halls, restaurants. A small, isolated metropolis which festers in its drabness and loneliness. The tone is jovial but dark; there is an undercurrent of poisonous irony to the narration. This world sounds like twisted wedding songs and show tunes with the batteries taken out.

The inhabitants of this world are mostly autopiloting their way through the vast suburban interiorscape.  This is the 'official' defence mechanism which protects the citizens of this world from the intense isolation and loneliness that everyone feels. It is an unfortunate world of broken toys.

There are a few people that are different and interesting and time slows down to tell their story. These individuals commune through 'music' - a medium and 'way of life' that is the only sane alternative to religion.

Hedwig meets a sheltered, blank canvas of a young man named Tommy Genesis who they cultivate into a fully featured personality.

By the end, Hedwig merges with their creation and they become one and the same person - the quest for wholeness is complete.
