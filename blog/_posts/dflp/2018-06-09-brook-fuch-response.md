For my response to Brook's book 'The Empty Space' I have separated out and identified some key insights.

# REPETITION IS DEADLY
The first insight, is the necessary but also self-destructive nature of repetition in rehearsal. A challenge for any successful work of theatre is to find a way to overcome the deadly, hollowing out of liveliness that occurs from repetition. A successful theatre must embrace its own ephemeral nature - it must respect the dynamic, shifting, ever-evolving understanding of the play itself.

The rules of rehearsal should not calcify or become stagnant, and this is expressed in the need for evolving challenges.

To begin with, there should not be any people who watch the rehearsal as 'hostile faces' could be creatively stifling. In the early phases there is a need for excesses, indulgences and incomprehensibility for which a trusting and safe environment is a precondition.  However, like any of Brook's rulings this is contingent on where the group is at in their creative process. At certain points in the process it may become entirely necessary for spectators to add tension, to break up habits and to catalyse group organization and precision.

Aggressive language and tone might be necessary at certain points in the process in the interest of speed and consolidation, however at other points this may be stifling.

Director is there to help group evolve towards ideal situation. To 'attack and yield', to 'provoke and withdraw until the indefinable stuff begins to flow'.


# OVERPREPARATION IS DEADLY

The director can prepare as much as they want, but given the fleshy nature of the materials of theatre there is no way for them to understand a play by themselves.  It is of primal importance for the form and construction of the play to evolve continuously - 'iterating, changing, scrapping'  as the whole gradually takes form.

Other members of the team have their own sensibilities which are likely to 'turn searchlights' onto the director and their process. An actor might do something 'unexpected and true' in rehearsal, and the director must have enough flexibility in their structure and vision to allow others to take this up and respond.

By soaking up these 'searchlights', the director can take advantage of the emergent creativity and richness of group creation methods.   However, this creates a point of tension as at other moments the director will need to take hold of their judgement to provide compactness and focus to the vision.

Ideally, the form of the directors 'blueprint' is 'incomplete'; 'clarity without rigidity', or 'open' rather than 'shut'- with the later the finalization of the design the better.

Managing a successful rehearsal is certainly more of an Art, than a science, with there being a time and place for almost any kind approach. The goal for rehearsal is to identify what the group is lacking, and to adjust catalysts and structure accordingly.


# THE OBSERVER

The observer plays a critical in the development of theatre. During rehearsal the 'vital assistance' of the observer comes from the director, whereas  in performance it is the audience.  In both cases, the gaze is what galvanizes and activates a performance, elevating the 'watcher' to a very vital and active role. The watcher is embroiled in this interaction with the performers whether they are aware of their participation or not.  This more spectral definition of interaction is an interesting provocation to the more physical definitions that are common today.

Brook's theatre is always interactive, as it takes place in the emotional environment that is created by the interactions between directors, designers, audience and stage.




#THE INVISIBLE EMOTIONAL CANVAS
emotional environment created by the director, the designer and the audience can make certain experiences possible.

#THE DIGITAL STAGE
I would like to consider these text in the context of how these ideas might contribute to more experimental forms of digital-based theatre. Underlying these considerations is the idea that a 'virtual world' such as the persistent, networked landscape of Azeroth in 'World of Warcraft' could be the stage for an 'Immediate Theatre' of the future.

The challenges that traditional theatre faces in terms of maintaining the 'incomplete' and 'open' that the interactive nature of an environment.

Is there room for a theatre that is once removed from flesh and blood of the stage? A Blind theatre? Is the completed circle made incomplete if we cannot directly see our actors but instead see them represented by symbols, or avatars?

Unlike the cinema - theatre is capable of 'asserting themselves in the present', which makes it 'more real than normal stream of consciousness'. The capacities for the artist to take hold of the medium and intervene into the audience mind is powerful and disturbing.

The 'immediate theatre' of the future looks something like an ongoing narrative which the audience member participate in and shape the development of. Theatre companies, or DIY run collectives will put together an engine for these kinds of narrative experiences and the audience will participate experiencing and defining the direction.
#CONCLUSION
Overall, Brook describes a fluid system - there is no 'language for everything'.

Fuchs
from the perspective of the actor but ths could also be taken more literally in terms of set design. this particular asset in this world, what would it feel like? what factions does it belong to? world building is almost like a simulationist approach to narrative. as you create the world and then the world simulates its own insides.
