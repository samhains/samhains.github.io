_At the end of a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where his comments were webcast, he was asked for his prediction on the future of the web. "I will answer very simply that the Internet will disappear," Schmidt said._

_"There will be so many IP addresses…so many devices, sensors, things that you are wearing, things that you are interacting with that you won’t even sense it," he explained. "It will be part of your presence all the time. Imagine you walk into a room, and the room is dynamic. And with your permission and all of that, you are interacting with the things going on in the room"._

**Concept**

I am interested in exploring some of the implications of this dystopian idea shared by Google CEO, Eric Schmidt, that the internet is 'disappearing' into something indistinguishable from our everyday reality.

In particular, ideas surrounding what might happen to our photos, footage and phone conversations. What if some of that information began to take on a life of its own? What if media companies found ways to use data from your archives to algorithmically generate scandalous, clickbait stories?

Hyper-localised gossip generating networks riff off your intimate personal data. Machinic auteurs remix your irony and sarcasm. You are transformed into a global meme sensation.

**Interactive installation proposal**

The 'user' participates in a simulated space, a mixed reality. The space might contain a mixture of objects that are being projected onto and can be interacted with.

The user may have the opportunity to speak to the system, through a device that looks like this:

Some ideas for the composition of this space involve:
* A collection of mannequin faces
* A surreal collection of readymades - disembodied mannequin parts, chairs and cages.
* A chair, a desk and a couple of monitors.

The system surveils the user as they engage with the space.

The user is asked to participate in a series of 'Are you a human?' tests like those seen as security checks in modern web browsers. These tests are more about having an individual participate in training an 'AI system' than testing if the user is a human. I would like to play with this idea - the machine testing us, questioning us - only to exploit our naivety.

The users face and voice is captured from the tests and projected onto the mannequin faces. Their face is then contorted, their voice stolen. They watch themselves behave like a 'buffoon' to an applauding, simulated audience.

The audience members - who applaud with the mindless cruelty of a nightmare; may also be mannequin faces appropriated from previous visitors of the space.

** Additional Ideas **

There might be an interface that provides an archive of previous visitors to the space, and the participant may have the option to further remix or reorganize that persons virtual identity.

This system might function as a database of 'shadow participants' who can be called forth to enact their artificial performance at any moment to an applauding virtual audience.
