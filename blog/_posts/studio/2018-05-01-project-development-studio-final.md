This is an extension of my on-going interest in exploring dystopian narratives through interactive audio-visual installation.<br />

It is also an extension, and advancement of the system that I built last year for the Winter show that is documented here.  <br />

# Concept
- How do we become a part of the spectacle?
- How does speculative lore and my practice intercept?

# Lessons about process
- Stagnation when continuing existing ideas
- Technical vs creative tension
- Too many ideas vs none at all
- Fitting too many ideas into one project

# Technical Lessons
- C++
- Open Frameworks
- GLSL
- Building C++ extensions in touch designer
- OpenCV

Hypervirus is a voice-controlled video installation depicting an entertainment network in conflict with a virus.
Consisting of a real-time, generative video system and a voice controlled interface - Hypervirus confronts the transformation of the internet into an algorithmic mirror of crowd behavior.<br />
<br />
The Hypervirus narrative takes place on a 24/7 cable network called 'Echo' - an algorithmically generated network featuring news, memes, e-sports and healing.<br />
<br />
By recycling, remixing and processing the internet in real-time, the system creates a sense of a reality where the automation of concept and content has become a totality.  <br />
<br />
The use of generative content is intended to create a theatrical, dystopian lore in which each user experiences a unique mixture of planned and emergent interaction.<br />
<br />
Through a series of diagnostic tests, announcements and voice interactions the user will attempt to identify and understand the virus that is destroying the network.  However, in attempting to diagnose the 'virus' the distinction between them and the system begins to blur.

This is the current status of the Hypervirus ideas:
