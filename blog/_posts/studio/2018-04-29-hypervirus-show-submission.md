Hypervirus is a voice-controlled video installation depicting an entertainment network in conflict with a virus.
Consisting of a real-time, generative video system and a voice controlled interface - Hypervirus confronts the transformation of the internet into an algorithmic mirror of crowd behavior.<br />
<br />
The Hypervirus narrative takes place on a 24/7 cable network called 'Echo' - an algorithmically generated network featuring news, memes, e-sports and healing.<br />
<br />
By recycling, remixing and processing the internet in real-time, the system creates a sense of a reality where the automation of concept and content has become a totality.  <br />
<br />
The use of generative content is intended to create a theatrical, dystopian lore in which each user experiences a unique mixture of planned and emergent interaction.<br />
<br />
Through a series of diagnostic tests, announcements and voice interactions the user will attempt to identify and understand the virus that is destroying the network.  However, in attempting to diagnose the 'virus' the distinction between them and the system begins to blur.

This is an extension of my on-going interest in exploring dystopian narratives through interactive audio-visual installation.<br />

It is also an extension, and advancement of the system that I built last year for the Winter show that is documented here.  <br />

From a technical perspective, I was interested in continuing experimentation into the development of generative, interactive video systems with voice controlled interfaces.

I have uploaded a video demonstrating the current state of the system. It is still a work in progress.
