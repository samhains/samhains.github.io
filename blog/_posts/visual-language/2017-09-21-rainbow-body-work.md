**GOOD SIGNS**

I found myself attracted to neon light sign design. Stardust Diner in Time Square is a nice combination of futurism and nostalgia.  It sits naturally in the uncanny maximalism of  Times Square.

Dublin house's Neon Harp sign in Manhattan's upper west side stands out with its beautiful Neon green and red colours.

**BAD SIGNS**

This is chaos: Push, pull, please, this arrow, that arrow. Stop here? Where?! A stressful welcome.

This cluster of signs for Rainbow Body care also caught my attention. The poor information organization and lack of visual hierarchy causes me fatigue.
