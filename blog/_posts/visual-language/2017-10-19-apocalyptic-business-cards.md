I decided to approach the task of Business card in a more formal fashion than some of my previous graphic design experiments. I started my explorations by studying the techniques and design strategies of dutch design agency, [Metahaven](http://metahaven.net/).

Of particular interest to me was their series of posters for the Holland festival.

I was captivated by the use of overlapping image outlines, which are filled in to create unusual and messy forms.

Feeling self-conscious about the idea handing someone a business card, I thought it would be funny to highlight the absurdity of this gesture by etching my name in an image of a burning planet earth.

I feel these are the most successful designs so far in my Graphic Design journey, and they are a testiment to a process that focuses more on studying the masters and learning from existing design patterns. This makes sense given how new I am to this form of communication.
