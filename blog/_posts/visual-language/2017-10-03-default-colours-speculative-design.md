For Visual Language class, at ITP, we were given the task of designing 6 graphics, based on a colour palette that reflected ones personality.

I first attempted to do this assignment in Cinema4D, as I want to learn how to design in 3D programs. However, I underestimated how challenging this would be technically and creatively, and ended up moving back to illustrator due to time constraints.

In illustrator my attempts continued to follow the process of playing with colour and form in an improvised way. The results were not good. My attempts to define myself with a colour scheme also felt superficial and abstract.

I decided that in order to connect with the task, I needed to come up with a concept that would drive the design.  I began my explorations by examining the aesthetics and design of anachronistic web interfaces.

Below are abstractions of the web forums 'hipinion' and 'ilxor' respectively. The text has been removed to express the aesthetic backdrop of these virtual spaces.

I attempted to create collages from these forum interfaces. Unsatisfied with the results, I started to experiment with Netscape and windows 95 interface components.  For this process I was inspired by Jan Robert Leegte's [scrollbars](https://rhizome.org/art/artbase/artwork/untitledscrollbars/), where the artist took  elements from the OSX interface and made collages with the scrollbars and other existing elements.

I am very interested in 'default' colours. The designer traditionally transforms defaults into design, however it is an interesting constraint to me when design is forced to be made with defaults.

The colour palette selected is monochromatic, with the exception of 'Pure Blue', which I find striking in contrast to monochromatic grey. It has a soothing quality, but there is also something unnatural and surreal about its purity.

While experimenting with these components, the idea evolved into creating a speculative interface.  The interface has not been designed for the human 'User' as we understand it. The graphical interface would suggest it is not an interface optimized for a machine either.  A human that encounters such an interface might need to decode it or use a scanning interface.
