Duchamp's revolutionary artwork 'The Fountain' is art as subversion of the familiar -  sanctifying the lie of art as some kind of 'superior ideal'. Duchamp exposed complacency and smugness surrounding our notions of art, initiating the motion to collapse the deception at the core of our distinction between 'art' and the 'real world'.  

A new discourse was born out of the 'readymade': What kind of framework for understanding 'art' could encompass both a Urinal purchased from a factory and a Pablo Picasso painting? Was such a framework necessary? Previous definitions of art involved requirements such technical benchmarks, notions of beauty or measures of emotional profundity which became difficult to sustain once works like 'The Fountain' were acknowledged.

So what is art in a culture that no longer has any objective standards around its ideal form or content?

My belief is that our attempts to create structures and definitions for an objective 'art' (or anything) are in vein - Reality is more plural than simple intuition might suggest. For Deleuze, the role of art is to magnify this sense the intuitive 'world as error', and to 'sanctify the lie' by elevating our self-deceptions about a singular 'objective reality' to a thing of mysterious beauty ('Nietszche and Philosophy', Deleuze 1964). Art has the capacity to excite our perceptual apperatus, and change the way that we interpret the world.

To me, the discourse around developing a classification system for what is and isn't art, emerging from the 'readymade' - is not important. Art is inherently a project to subvert the familiar. If the familiar or 'clearly knowable' has become our conception of art itself, Art will be the force that dissimulates that notion.
