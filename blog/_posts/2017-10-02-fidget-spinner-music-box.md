Starting from the project that was mentioned [here](http://samhains.com/blog/physcomp/2017/09/22/fidget-spinner-switch-to-neopixel.html)Â - I transformed the silly spinner into a music box by attaching an additional speaker to the Arduino powering the LEDs. When you spin it, it plays 'Pop Goes The Weasel'.
