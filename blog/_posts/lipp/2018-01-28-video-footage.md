To begin with, I experimented with using the zoom to find landscapes within landscapes. I was hoping that by focusing on things up-close, I could play with our sense of scale. As I experimented with the digital zoom, I discovered that it introduces some interesting distortions and artefacts. I started experimenting with a constraint: shoot all of the video footage with the digital zoom maxed-out.

There were some interesting consequences of this. It created a discrepancy between the way my eye saw the world and the way the world looked on my phone - which created some unexpected results.

Another consequence was the way that the zoom made my breathing and movement more obvious.

I liked the way that screens looked when zoomed all the way in. The combination of digital zoom, and the rapid movement of screen lights created some interesting distortions.

As my journey progressed, I found myself continuously drawn to the way that electronics and screens appeared as integrated into the urban environment.
