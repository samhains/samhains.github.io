To begin with, I experimented with using the zoom to find landscapes within landscapes. As I experimented with the zoom, I discovered that when I max out my digital zoom on my Samsung galaxy - it introduces some interesting artefacts. I decided to experiment with introducing a constraint: i would shoot all of the footage with the digital zoom maxed-out.

There were some interesting consequences of this. The zoom made my breathing and movement more obvious. It also tended to remove the context from a lot of the shots. Shooting a screen in the world, when you are zoomed all the way in, removes the context of the 'screen'. It's just another visual being sampled. The zoom gives a strange perspective on shadows and forms too.

The combination of digital zoom, and the rapid movement of LED lights and screens created a compounding effect of interesting distortions.


I found myself drawn to the way that electronics and screens were integrated into the environment. I buried my phone into screens and LED's to create distortions.
