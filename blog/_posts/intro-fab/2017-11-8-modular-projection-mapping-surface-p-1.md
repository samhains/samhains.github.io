I built some surfaces that could be projected on and used for prototyping installations.

**PARTS AND TOOLS**

* White Coroplast sheets
* Drills and drill bits
* Sanding Paper or Sanding Machine
* Glue Gun
* Ban Saw
* Stanley Knife aka. Exacto Blade
* Gridded cutting board

Once I had the materials, I had to spend time measuring and drawing lines in the Coroplast to start cutting up the faces that would be used to assemble the surfaces.

This was challenging, due to the size of the Coroplast sheets that I purchased and the limited space I had access to in ITP's fabrication shop. I found that my results were improved as soon as I started orienting the ruler and the tape measure with the assistance of a gridded cutting board.

Another challenge is accounting for the various ways that the box would be overlapping or underlapping at the edges and corners. I settled on the following dimensions by taking into account the thickness of the material (0.157"):

* 6"x6" (Left and Right)
* 7"x6" (Front and Back)
* 7.314"x6" (Top and Bottom)

Once the lines had been drawn, I started cutting up the board with the blade. Better results were achieved when cuts were proceeded by a single, light handed incision.

I threw together a little 'pancake' with Hot Glue to get a sense of how my calculations were stacking up.

I decided to cute up some wood cubes to give the structure better support at its corners.

I used the Ban Saw to cut up a piece of scrap wood.

A vice came in handy to work with some of the irregular combinations of pieces.

The pieces were assembled together with hot glue.

The pieces were arranged and tested with Touch designer.

** CONCLUSION **

While Coroplast is cheap and works well with projectors introducing it into the Fabrication process introduced some constraints. The flexibility of the material makes it difficult to work with saws and The flammability prevents use with the Lazer cutter.  The Stanley Knife (Exacto!) requires some skill and getting used to, but I could see it being an invaluable tool for future experiments with this material.

The next blog post will detail experimenting  with magnets to make these surfaces both modular and compose-able.
