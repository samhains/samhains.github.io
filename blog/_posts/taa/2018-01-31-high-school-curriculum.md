Homework Notes:
 Longterm outcomes. not specific classes but the way they connect. what are the goals, why will this work? why wont it? less interested in educational structure.  how could you help yourself go to college they want, but circumvent that and find alternatives..Programming as virtual possibility and social currency. scripting in second life.

One big problem for me was that because I was good at maths so I felt like i was typified as this kind of student. I got categorized as a 'maths student' and it seemed like I shouldn't pursue arts or creativity. I spent a long time unlearning this.

 friends that were very engaged in learning about art and literature. we would meet and talk about these things. it was motivating. Then i think i took this approach of 'nerding out' online, and found online communities.
