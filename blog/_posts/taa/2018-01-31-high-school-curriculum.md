_Work in progress_

Learning objective: Students will learn "" in a collection of classes, over a semester, an academic year or degree.

Learning outcome: Student will achieve " " through the class.

This curriculum is designed to encourage creative thinking, self-confidence and a sense of broader community purpose. Students are encouraged to explore where their curiosity takes them, and the teachers are expected to be flexible enough to accomodate for students to experiment and explore. Students will be encouraged to explore themselves through performance, artistic expression and poetry. Rationality and rigorous , logical process will be encouraged through Mathematics, sciences and economics however students will be encouraged to think with both sides of the brain. Plurality and multiplicity are core aspects of this philosophy.


The school does not believe in categorizing students or pigeoning holing them into particular categories. Barriers between left and right brain are ficticious. Aptitude is de-emphasized, passion and curiosity is rewarded.

Facebook is banned, social networks are banned, the students must develop their local network to communicate with eachother. Within this space there are very few rules. Classes are given to provide tooling to allow students to develop their own network.

Religion is removed and replaced with spirituality, philosophy and community art practice.

This is a non-competitive environment, students will not play competitive sports. Students will learn to be self motivated, and curious.

Students are encouraged, and incentiveized to create interest groups and study groups where they meet with their peers to develop niche or specific interest into subjects.

There are no specific subjects, rather multidisciplinary, conceptual classes that overlap with eachother.

Community engagement is found throughout the curriculum.

Virtual environments and simulations are also used extensively throughout the curriculum to provide students for a number of reasons:
* the opportunity to build confidence and experiment.
* to provide unique opportunities for play.
* to explore themes of digital subversion.
* to develop digital literacy
* to encourage collaborative, playful forms of education
* World building

Performance, Dance, Economics, Philosophy and Spirituality will all engage with simulation and virtual environment.

## Teaching philosophy

Age appropriate. Harmonious society, learn to live together. Egalatarian, less emphasis on  competition. Not just academic, but also experiential. Deep interest and curiosity about the world - how to inspire this? About inspiration, questions. Community - how to develop? Cooking, Gardening skills. Movement and dance. When is the child ready? What does the child need? Integration of thinking, doing and making. Movement instead of sports. Biology bones, physics gravity -> gymnastics and summersault. Music and Dance integral to the development of thinking capacity. Musicology and ethnography. All teachers to strive towards wholeness in lesson. Enjoyment of working. Confidence building, before other things.   Used to independent working. Non-judgemental, creativity, respectful of other people. Competition not with other people, but with selves. Thinking of the teachers is very important. Freedom with students. Teaching is a learning profession - Not there to deliver knowledge but you are there to grow with children.  About wanting to learn, wanting to learn and wanting to meet the world.

"A curriculum which acknowledges the social responsibilities of education must present situations where problems are relevant to the problems of living together, and where observation and information are calculated to develop social insight and interest."

Longterm outcomes. not specific classes but the way they connect. what are the goals, why will this work? why wont it? less interested in educational structure.  how could you help yourself go to college they want, but circumvent that and find alternatives.. Programming as virtual possibility and social currency. scripting in second life.
