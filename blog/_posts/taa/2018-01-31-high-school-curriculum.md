Teaching philosophy

Age appropriate. Harmonious society, learn to live together. Egalatarian, less emphasis on  competition. Not just academic, but also experiential. Deep interest and curiosity about the world - how to inspire this? About inspiration, questions. Community - how to develop? Cooking, Gardening skills. Movement and dance. When is the child ready? What does the child need? Integration of thinking, doing and making. Movement instead of sports. Biology bones, physics gravity -> gymnastics and summersault. Music and Dance integral to the development of thinking capacity. Musicology and ethnography. All teachers to strive towards wholeness in lesson. Enjoyment of working. Confidence building, before other things.   Used to independent working. Non-judgemental, creativity, respectful of other people. Competition not with other people, but with selves. Thinking of the teachers is very important. Freedom with students. Teaching is a learning profession - Not there to deliver knowledge but you are there to grow with children.  About wanting to learn, wanting to learn and wanting to meet the world. 

"A curriculum which acknowledges the social responsibilities of education must present situations where problems are relevant to the problems of living together, and where observation and information are calculated to develop social insight and interest."

Homework Notes:
 Longterm outcomes. not specific classes but the way they connect. what are the goals, why will this work? why wont it? less interested in educational structure.  how could you help yourself go to college they want, but circumvent that and find alternatives..Programming as virtual possibility and social currency. scripting in second life.

One big problem for me was that because I was good at maths so I felt like i was typified as this kind of student. I got categorized as a 'maths student' and it seemed like I shouldn't pursue arts or creativity. I spent a long time unlearning this.

 friends that were very engaged in learning about art and literature. we would meet and talk about these things. it was motivating. Then i think i took this approach of 'nerding out' online, and found online communities.

 Remove religion - replace with philosophy and spirituality
 Remove sport - make non-competitive
