_Work in progress_

"A rhizomatic plant has no center and no defined boundary; rather, it is made up of a number of semi-independent nodes, each of which is capable of growing and spreading on its own, bounded only by the limits of its habitat (Cormier 2008)."

"In the rhizomatic view, knowledge can only be negotiated, and the contextual, collaborative learning experience shared by constructivist and connectivist pedagogies is a social as well as a personal knowledge-creation process with mutable goals and constantly negotiated premises. The rhizome metaphor, which represents a critical leap in coping with the loss of a canon against which to compare, judge, and value knowledge, may be particularly apt as a model for disciplines on the bleeding edge where the canon is fluid and knowledge is a moving target."

The wiki, or any collaboratively constructed document for that matter, solves a number of issues inherent to the expert-driven model as it has the capacity to be more current than any expert-assessed content package or traditional publication can usually be. Wikis and similar tools offer a participatory medium that can allow for communal negotiation of knowledge.

In the rhizomatic model of learning, curriculum is not driven by predefined inputs from experts; it is constructed and negotiated in real time by the contributions of those engaged in the learning process. This community acts as the curriculum, spontaneously shaping, constructing, and reconstructing itself and the subject of its learning in the same way that the rhizome responds to changing environmental conditions

With this model, a community can construct a model of education flexible enough for the way knowledge develops and changes today by producing a map of contextual knowledge. The living curriculum of an active community is a map that is always "detachable, connectible, reversible, modifiable, and has multiple entryways and exits":

combining their blogs with information to which Couros pointed them and linking the combination to the particular knowledge that they discovered through discussions with key people in Couros’s professional community.

Teacher provides introduciton to the community, students participate. Teacher provides window into an existing learning community.

Each subject is a 'community'.

Through involvement in multiple communities where new information is being assimilated and tested, educators can begin to apprehend the moving target that is knowledge in the modern learning environment.

A 'living curriculum', self determined communities generate and negotiate their own knowledge, forming the basis of what its members learn. Embrace the open ended nature of knowledge that seems to be confirmed by todays fracturing information worlds.

Self determined pathways - familiar to learners in digital age.

problem - new theories are descriptive of specific new phenomena. chaotic, networked and digitally mediated communication and learning is widespread, iterative, negotiable.

the members themselves will connect the node to the larger network. Most people are members of several communities—acting as core members in some, carrying more weight and engaging more extensively in the discussion, while offering more casual contributions in others, reaping knowledge from more involved members (Cormier 2007). This is the new reality.

According to Brown and Adler (2008), "The most profound impact of the Internet, an impact that has yet to be fully realized, is its ability to support and expand the various aspects of social learning" (18).

Previous model - " In this model, the experts are the arbiters of the canon. The expert translation of data into verified knowledge is the central process guiding traditional curriculum development."

MOOC's - Massive Open Online courses. informal learning ocmmunities., democratic, self-governed, premised on self-determined needs and outcomes.

Learn by working together, sharing experience and understanding.

A platform for local internets. Building de-centralized internets.

Learning is contextual: it is both practical and creative, reflective and socially accouuntable.

Peer learning. The open web and the connections we make between people as the curriculum, participating in the community is the curriculum. Learning has no beginning and end. By exploring communities or context you can learn how language is used. Disbelief in cannon.

Classroom/network as an ecosystem in which each person is spreading his or her own understanding among the pieces of information available in that ecosystem. Publically wending one's way through  that accumulation of knowledge (by content creation and sharing) provides contextual curriculum to remix back into the existing research/thoughts/ideas in a given field. An individuals own rhizomatic learning experience creates a curriculum for others.

To be successful students  have to grasp how to situate themselves in a group. Lurkers, commenters, contributers, linkers. Students have opportunity to hack and create new combinations of information and technology. Empower students for learning and provide them with appropriate technological tools, then learners have the opportunity to play - encouraged to use technologies in ways that they were not intended to get new results. Students have opportunities for tinkering and hacking online that they might not have in onsite environments.

No set classes. The an open space with good internet. The class is structured like a rhizome. Students explore their own ideas and follow an online curriculum. With workshops and classes. Students are given tools for building up the network. Hybrid between online/virtual networks. Blurring lines between online and offline learning in a novel way. Students can create informational products more easily in this space - ebooks, animations, videos, documentation which can be shared with others. Emails discussions and chats leave learning artifacts. Teachers analyse these artifacts and provide thoughtful feedback.

Cons ->  students and teachers need technical literacy. students would need to acknowledge the principles of the new pedagogical process which might be a challegne. accepting and learning their new position in the learning process.

Learning objective: Students will learn "" in a collection of classes, over a semester, an academic year or degree.

Learning outcome: Student will achieve " " through the class.

The ephemeral nature of the Web and the rate at which cutting-edge knowledge about it and on it becomes obsolete disrupts the painstaking process by which knowledge has traditionally been codified.


Traditional curricular domains are based on long-accepted knowledge, and the "experts" in those domains are easily identified by comparing their assertions with the canon of accepted thought (Banks 1993); newer concepts, whether in technology, physics, or modern culture, are not easily compared against any canon. This lack of a center of measurement for what is "true" or "right" makes the identification of key pieces of knowledge in any of these fields a precarious task. In less-traditional curricular domains then, knowledge creators are not accurately epitomized as traditional, formal, verified experts; rather, knowledge in these areas is created by a broad collection of knowers sharing in the construction and ongoing evolution of a given field. Knowledge becomes a negotiation (Farrell 2001).

This curriculum is designed to encourage creative thinking, self-confidence and a sense of broader community purpose. Students are encouraged to explore where their curiosity takes them, and the teachers are expected to be flexible enough to accomodate for students to experiment and explore. Students will be encouraged to explore themselves through performance, artistic expression and poetry. Rationality and rigorous , logical process will be encouraged through Mathematics, sciences and economics however students will be encouraged to think with both sides of the brain. Plurality and multiplicity are core aspects of this philosophy.

Toxic masculinity - literature curriculum will be diverse, culturally. queer film, and literature.  

"Thus experience is not confined to a personal Cogito of a Cartesian subject but represents an experiment with the environing world: we can, and should, learn from experience. Multiplicity and plurality are core to the curriculum."

Experience is rendered meaningful not just by grounding empirical particulars in abstract universals but by experimentation, that is, by treating any concept ‘‘as an object of an encounter, as a here-and-now ... from which emerge inexhaustibly ever new, differently distributed ‘heres’ and ‘nows’ ... . I make, remake and unmake my concepts along a moving horizon, from an always decentered center, from an always displaced periphery which repeats and differentiates them.’

The making and remaking of concepts constitutes a creative process

education as a process of learning from and evaluating experience, inventing concepts in practice, and creating novel meanings.

Rhizomatic learning - In contrast to goal-directed and hierarchical theories of learning, it posits that learning is most effective when it allows participants to react to evolving circumstances, preserving lines of flight that allow a fluid and continually evolving redefinition of the task at hand.[4] In such a structure, "the community is the curriculum", subverting traditional notions of instructional design where objectives pre-exist student involvement.

rhizoid structure of curriculum, and its potential to free us[who?] from the linearity associated with much educational structure.[

In this situation, teaching cannot be easily seen as a authoritarian activity but more like "subversive activity" (Postman & Weingartner, 1971) in which teachers, along with their students, compare information from various sources, negotiate their knowledge and experiences together, and interpret the world."

How can web technologies redefine pedagogic behaviour  - we don't want to work with digital analogous behaviour.

Utilize network structures, that already form private lives. Technology as more than a note taking tool.

Knowledge sphere is dependant on learners ability to master learning procecsses in networks.

Not A to B but a map of possible learning paths,  with multiple ways to carry out the task than one. Learners co-design activities and widen map of possibilities.

network collaboration and co-creation.

reality is both real and socially constructed. there are ways to interfere with this reality both in semantic shifts and physical intervention.

wifi, laptops, collaboration networks -> rhizome structure.

the 'digital learning habitat' is a learning environment where teaching and learning is redefined by the precense of technology and the emergence of the habitat.

network literacy, community of practice which is a collaboration where all participate equally and where participants are interdependent on one another in a reification of a joint project. collaborative mind mapping tools, presentation tools, word processing tools google docs. simulteneous collaboration.

move from paper to word the next phase is movement to google docs - simulteneous production.


Downsides ->  individual acocuntability, and simulteneous interaction within groups. but interdependability between groups?

authentic collaboration where students rely on eachother to reach a common goal - need new assignments that make the new structures (rhizomatic) necesasry. google docs and prezi too easy to operate the mechanism.



The school does not believe in categorizing students or pigeoning holing them into particular categories. Barriers between left and right brain are ficticious. Aptitude is de-emphasized, passion and curiosity is rewarded.

Facebook is banned, social networks are banned, the students must develop their local network to communicate with eachother. Within this space there are very few rules. Classes are given to provide tooling to allow students to develop their own network.

Religion is removed and replaced with spirituality, philosophy and community art practice.

This is a non-competitive environment, students will not play competitive sports. Students will learn to be self motivated, and curious.

Students are encouraged, and incentiveized to create interest groups and study groups where they meet with their peers to develop niche or specific interest into subjects.

There are no specific subjects, rather multidisciplinary, conceptual classes that overlap with eachother.

Community engagement is found throughout the curriculum.

Virtual environments and simulations are also used extensively throughout the curriculum to provide students for a number of reasons:
* the opportunity to build confidence and experiment.
* to provide unique opportunities for play.
* to explore themes of digital subversion.
* to develop digital literacy
* to encourage collaborative, playful forms of education
* World building

Performance, Dance, Economics, Philosophy and Spirituality will all engage with simulation and virtual environment.

Social Art practice/ ecology

## Teaching philosophy

Age appropriate. Harmonious society, learn to live together. Egalatarian, less emphasis on  competition. Not just academic, but also experiential. Deep interest and curiosity about the world - how to inspire this? About inspiration, questions. Community - how to develop? Cooking, Gardening skills. Movement and dance. When is the child ready? What does the child need? Integration of thinking, doing and making. Movement instead of sports. Biology bones, physics gravity -> gymnastics and summersault. Music and Dance integral to the development of thinking capacity. Musicology and ethnography. All teachers to strive towards wholeness in lesson. Enjoyment of working. Confidence building, before other things.   Used to independent working. Non-judgemental, creativity, respectful of other people. Competition not with other people, but with selves. Thinking of the teachers is very important. Freedom with students. Teaching is a learning profession - Not there to deliver knowledge but you are there to grow with children.  About wanting to learn, wanting to learn and wanting to meet the world.

"A curriculum which acknowledges the social responsibilities of education must present situations where problems are relevant to the problems of living together, and where observation and information are calculated to develop social insight and interest."

Longterm outcomes. not specific classes but the way they connect. what are the goals, why will this work? why wont it? less interested in educational structure.  how could you help yourself go to college they want, but circumvent that and find alternatives.. Programming as virtual possibility and social currency. scripting in second life.
