### Course Description:

Technological advancements have us creating new worlds faster than we can keep track of them. This course will introduce students to the process of critically engaging with these new worlds and their implications. Through philosophy, performance and social engagement students will consider the problems and creative possibilities of our real, virtual and online communities.

#### Week 1
Session 01:  Introduction to Metaphysics. Plato's Cave. Realism and Idealism.<br/>

#### Week 2:
Session 03: Reality as a social construction. Drawing from Deleuze's 'Assemblage Theory' we will consider how ideas and systems can be broken down into other ideas and yet maintain their significance as a whole.
