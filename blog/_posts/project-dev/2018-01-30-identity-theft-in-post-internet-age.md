_At the end of a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where his comments were webcast, he was asked for his prediction on the future of the web. "I will answer very simply that the Internet will disappear," Schmidt said._

_"There will be so many IP addresses…so many devices, sensors, things that you are wearing, things that you are interacting with that you won’t even sense it," he explained. "It will be part of your presence all the time. Imagine you walk into a room, and the room is dynamic. And with your permission and all of that, you are interacting with the things going on in the room"._

For my next project, I am interested in exploring some of the implications of the idea that the internet is 'disappearing' into something indistinguishable from our everyday reality.

In particular, what might happen to our archives of personal data, photos, footage and phone conversations. What if some of that information began to take on a life of its own? What if a media companies began to dip into your archives to algorithmically generate scandalous, clickbait stories. Hyper-localised and specific gossip generating networks riff off intimate personal data. While other genius machinic auteurs remix your moments of irony and sarcasm, transforming your image into a global meme sensation.

One way of exploring this concept would be through the development of an 'immersive installation' experience.

The participant participates in a mixed reality, simulated space. The space will contain a mixture of real objects.

Some ideas for the composition of this space involve:
* Mannequins representing a simulated audience and a simulated star of the show.
* A more surreal installation of ready-made objects - disembodied mannequin parts, chairs and cages.
* A chair, a desk.

The system captures the individuals engagement with the system and their face and voice are projected onto the mannequin who behaves like a buffoon to an applauding simulated audience.

There might be an interface that provides an archive of previous visitors to the space, and the participant may have the option to further remix or reorganize that persons virtual identity.

The system might function as a database of 'shadow participants' who can be called forth to enact their artificial performance at any moment to an applauding virtual audience.
