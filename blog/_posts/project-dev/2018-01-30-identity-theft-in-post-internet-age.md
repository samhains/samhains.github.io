_At the end of a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where his comments were webcast, he was asked for his prediction on the future of the web. "I will answer very simply that the Internet will disappear," Schmidt said.

"There will be so many IP addresses…so many devices, sensors, things that you are wearing, things that you are interacting with that you won’t even sense it," he explained. "It will be part of your presence all the time. Imagine you walk into a room, and the room is dynamic. And with your permission and all of that, you are interacting with the things going on in the room"._

For my next project, I am interested in exploring some of the implications of the idea that the internet might 'disappear' into something indistinguishable from our everyday reality.
