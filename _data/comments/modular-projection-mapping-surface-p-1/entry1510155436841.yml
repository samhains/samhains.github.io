message: "Nice work.  Yes, never put a plastic you are unfamiliar with in the laser.\r\n\r\nI wonder if you could have cut down the plastic with the panel saw (we haven't gone over it yet).  It might have made some of your long cuts very quickly.  Did you ever consider folding the plastic to make edges instead of cutting individual surfaces?\r\n\r\nHow does the material work as a projection surface?"
