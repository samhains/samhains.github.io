message: "Good work.  Using existing electronics as a project enclosure can be challenging.  Good job drilling out the rivets (the plug/screws).\r\n\r\nI'd like to see more documentation.  I don't know how the microphone is attached to the phone receiver.  I don't know how the Arduino is mounted to the phone.  I don't know how the speakers are mounted.  Are you using the coiled phone cord or something else to attach the phone to the receiver?  More documentation please."
