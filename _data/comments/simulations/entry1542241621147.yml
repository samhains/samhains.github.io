message: "I wonder if Ian Bogost could be of use to you?\r\nmaybe not this... but I am not clear what *you* mean by simulation at this point - i am wary of too much theory making it impossible to make something:) simulation f what? and to what end? FEMA used Second Life to run disaster simulations. approximations of real-life situations. is worlding a sim for the future? are we actually having to do real-world future-like things in there?"
