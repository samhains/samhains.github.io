  Great development on this project. Mixed with the chromakey it looks really
  impressive! In terms of performing this system I would think about how to
  create moments for your audience to breathe and process, cleanse their palette
  so to speak. I love chaos and intensity and use it a lot in my own work but
  it's much more effective when you move through different moods and energies
  that punctuate the intensity. Maybe their are some effects where you have the
  sprites generated as linear ramps and lines rather than randomly placed each
  time. Shapes and form as a method of generation can give things a sense of
  order.
