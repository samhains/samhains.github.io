message: "Good work.  I think you might be working too hard to get a perfect fit.  I would cut some acrylic, or paint the wood shapes you already have white, and project onto them.  See if higher precision is even necessary.  Don't play the perfect game this early in the project development.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that painting over the surfaces may give you the best results, but it will definitely take more time in the long run.  I wouldn't abandon this technique just yet."
