    <p>I decided to have a go at redesigning some of the signage and marketing that was put together by Rainbow Body Care in St. Marks Place.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/bad5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>My sense was that there was something rather charming, and playful about the rainbow coloured branding and playful use of typography - however there was way too much information being presented, without hierarchy or sufficient design organisation.</p>

<p>I thought it would be fun to inject some more self awareness into their branding, and provide a poster that would maybe wink at itself a little.</p>

<p>I first attempted to recreate the style of the Pachinko’s Big Bet, which was a failure.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/rainbow1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I abandoned this before finishing, as I was running up against limitations in my abilities with Illustrator and graphic design.</p>

<p>My next step was to try something less ambitious, and to work with some of the existing references. I noticed that there were 7 proposed remedies in the initial signs, and also 7 colours of the rainbow.   I proposed having these 7 remedies vanish with the rainbow. Instead of explaining ‘This is what we can help you with’,  I considered that it would be simpler and more direct to represent the 7 ailments  vanishing with the tail of the rainbow. The curving Rainbow typeface references the shape of the rainbow.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/rainbow%20body%20work.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>I used Arial for the type face, and a basic Rainbow colour scheme. All very boring, but it is a start.</p>
