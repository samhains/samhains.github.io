&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARTS AND TOOLS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;White Coroplast sheets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drills and drill bits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sanding Paper or Sanding Machine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Glue Gun&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ban Saw&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stanley Knife aka. Exacto Blade&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gridded cutting board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/modular_projector/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had the materials, I had to spend time measuring and drawing lines in the Coroplast to start cutting up the faces that would be used to assemble the surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was challenging, due to the size of the Coroplast sheets that I purchased and the limited space I had access to in ITP’s fabrication shop. I found that my results were improved as soon as I started orienting the ruler and the tape measure with the assistance of a gridded cutting board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is accounting for the various ways that the box overlaps and underlapping at its edges. I settled on the following dimensions by taking into account the thickness of the material (0.157”):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;6”x6” (Left and Right)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7”x6” (Front and Back)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;7.314”x6” (Top and Bottom)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/modular_projector/3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the lines had been drawn, I started cutting up the board with the blade. Better results were achieved when cuts were proceeded by a single, light handed incision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/modular_projector/2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I threw together a little ‘pancake’ with Hot Glue to get a sense of how my calculations were stacking up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/modular_projector/4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to cut up some wood cubes to give the structure better support at its corners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/modular_projector/5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the Ban Saw to cut up a piece of scrap wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/modular_projector/7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vice came in handy to work with some of the irregular combinations of pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/modular_projector/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pieces were assembled together with hot glue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/modular_projector/6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/modular_projector/10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pieces were arranged and tested with Touch designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/modular_projector/11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Coroplast is cheap and works well with projectors; introducing it into a Fabrication process introduces some constraints. The flexibility (amount of ‘give’) of the material makes it difficult to work with saws. The flammability prevents use with lazer cutters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stanley Knife (Exacto!) requires some skill and getting used to, but once practiced provides a great deal of control and precision. With further practice, more advanced surfaces for projection mapping could be designed and implemented with such techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next blog post will detail experimenting  with magnets to make these surfaces both modular and compose-able.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I built some surfaces that could be projected on and used for prototyping installations.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Making an Altoid can into a laser</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/intro-fab/2017/10/31/making-a-light.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Making an Altoid can into a laser" /><published>2017-10-31T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-10-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/intro-fab/2017/10/31/making-a-light</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/intro-fab/2017/10/31/making-a-light.html">&lt;p&gt;After a couple of months of eager  overcomplicating,  I decided I would approach the first Fabrication assignment as simply, and as cheaply as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARTS AND TOOLS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Altoid Tin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red and black wires&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3V red laser diode&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Basic switch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soldering Iron with wire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping hands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drills and drill bits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sanding Paper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Glue Gun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROCESS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with an Altoid tin, I pulled out  a range  of drills so that I could slowly and progressively drill holes in the Altoid can for the laser and switch to enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/introfab_1_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to drill the hole. This proved to be a little more complicated to do ‘perfectly’ than imagined. The drill created a lot of ‘blowout’  with the metal, which was difficult to sand without wrecking the finish on the interior of the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/introfab_1_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to solder the wires to the switches and the laser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/intro_fab_1_5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a glue gun to add some protection to the wires that had been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/intro_fab_1_6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I connected all the wires to power to test that everything was working correctly. After confirming this, the next step was to use the glue gun to attach the laser diode to the hole that was drilled and to screw in the switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/intro_fab_1_7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…And there it is, a very simple laser in an Altoid tin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/intro_fab_1_8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laser diode I bought from Tinkersphere, and was not very high quality. The overall light emitted from the laser is a little lacklustre. A quality laser diode may improve my beam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to spend some time looking into techniques to drill into tin in a neater way if I was to do this again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">After a couple of months of eager overcomplicating, I decided I would approach the first Fabrication assignment as simply, and as cheaply as possible.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">PLUTO (C:)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/faking-the-news/2017/10/19/pluto-community-networking-evolved.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="PLUTO (C:)" /><published>2017-10-19T17:12:02-04:00</published><updated>2017-10-19T17:12:02-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/faking-the-news/2017/10/19/pluto-community-networking-evolved</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/faking-the-news/2017/10/19/pluto-community-networking-evolved.html">&lt;p&gt;For my final project for ‘Faking the news’, I build a web community that has been overun by a swarm of bots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;pluto-c.net&quot;&gt;http://pluto-c.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/pluto-1.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of real-time scraping of data from &lt;a href=&quot;ilxor.com&quot;&gt;ilxor&lt;/a&gt;, subreddits&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/&quot;&gt; /r/politics&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/&quot;&gt; /r/The_Donald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/genekogan/ebd77196e4bf0705db51f86431099e57&quot;&gt;google image search scraping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow&quot;&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/im2txt&quot;&gt;algorithms&lt;/a&gt;- the Pluto-C program creates a family of deranged bots reflecting forum and internet culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;pluto-c.net/forum/4-memiverse&quot;&gt;memiverse sub-forum&lt;/a&gt; - I am particularly happy with. The aesthetics of online meme discussions lead themselves to particularly disturbing robot reflections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/meme-dcgan-1.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of the forum was an attempt to create the ‘feeling’ of an abandoned web space. It was designed to be both anachronistic but also a love letter to the aesthetics of the nascent web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the machines have moved in, we experience a sense of ‘digital gentrification’ as the once familiar interface of the message board has becomes alien to us. We are no longer relevant or necessary. I like to think of the analogy of an abandoned theme park that is now home to a swarm of insects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project is a metaphor for the current state of the internet in 2017 and I hope that the basic sense of the internet as a ‘human space’  is perverted by the experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">For my final project for ‘Faking the news’, I build a web community that has been overun by a swarm of bots.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Apocalyptic Business Cards</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/vlang/2017/10/19/apocalyptic-business-cards.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Apocalyptic Business Cards" /><published>2017-10-19T16:51:31-04:00</published><updated>2017-10-19T16:51:31-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/vlang/2017/10/19/apocalyptic-business-cards</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/vlang/2017/10/19/apocalyptic-business-cards.html">&lt;p&gt;I decided to approach the task of Business card in a more formal fashion than some of my previous graphic design experiments. I started my explorations by studying the techniques and design strategies of dutch design agency, &lt;a href=&quot;http://metahaven.net/&quot;&gt;Metahaven&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest to me was their series of posters for the Holland festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/5403f19912bfeed40506693eddd1b882.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was captivated by the use of overlapping image outlines, which are filled in to create unusual and messy forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling self-conscious about the idea handing someone a business card, I thought it would be funny to highlight the absurdity of this gesture by etching my name in an image of a burning planet earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel these are the most successful designs so far in my Graphic Design journey, and they are a testiment to a process that focuses more on studying the masters and learning from existing design patterns. This makes sense given how new I am to this form of communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I decided to approach the task of Business card in a more formal fashion than some of my previous graphic design experiments.

&lt;p&gt;I used Skanect with a Structure Sensor to do the scans.  I then imported the scans into Cinema4d where I experimented with various compositions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main design problem that I faced was wanting to express the artificiality of the 3D scans in a 2D space. I wanted to distance myself from perfection, but also make it clear that these were not simply doctored photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experimented with cell shading to emphasise the 3D nature of the models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/reduced_black_outlines.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pleased with these results, and I attempted to composit these back onto the models in photoshop.  Unfortunately,  I felt this made the design too ‘busy’ and ‘gadgety’. The focus was distracted to be on the models and their inherent aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/cells.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are devices that strive towards perfection, and fall short. I believe there is a poetry in the failure of these ambitious devices, and in the vulnerability that they communicate in their nascent development phase. I like the artifacts that the technology creates, so I decided to emphasise the decay and imperfections and ended with this design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first attempted to do this assignment in Cinema4D, as I want to learn how to design in 3D programs. However, I underestimated how challenging this would be technically and creatively, and ended up moving back to illustrator due to time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/flower_sculpture2.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In illustrator my attempts continued to follow the process of playing with colour and form in an improvised way. The results were not good. My attempts to define myself with a colour scheme also felt superficial and abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided that in order to connect with the task, I needed to come up with a concept that would drive the design.  I began my explorations by examining the aesthetics and design of anachronistic web interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are abstractions of the web forums ‘hipinion’ and ‘ilxor’ respectively. The text has been removed to express the aesthetic backdrop of these virtual spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/hipinion.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/ilxor.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attempted to create collages from these forum interfaces. Unsatisfied with the results, I started to experiment with Netscape and windows 95 interface components.  For this process I was inspired by Jan Robert Leegte’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://rhizome.org/art/artbase/artwork/untitledscrollbars/&quot;&gt;scrollbars&lt;/a&gt;, where the artist took  elements from the OSX interface and made collages with the scrollbars and other existing elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very interested in ‘default’ colours. The designer traditionally transforms defaults into design, however it is an interesting constraint to me when design is forced to be made with defaults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colour palette selected is monochromatic, with the exception of ‘Pure Blue’, which I find striking in contrast to monochromatic grey. It has a soothing quality, but there is also something unnatural and surreal about its purity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While experimenting with these components, the idea evolved into creating a speculative interface.  The interface has not been designed for the human ‘User’ as we understand it. The graphical interface would suggest it is not an interface optimized for a machine either.  A human that encounters such an interface might need to decode it or use a scanning interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/palette_w4-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Each text size is a factor of 2 of the other.  Negative space was used to allocate distinct sections for different pieces of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roboto Condensed was used in addition to Roboto in order to fit more content. Wider kerning was used for headers in order to have text line up. High contrast was used to draw attention to the most important information and to give a strong but simple sense of hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the unreliable nature of boarding and departure times, they have been relegated to a lower point on the design hierarchy.  People typically have to strain their eyes looking to match their flight number with the flight information on the grids of screens at airports to confirm flight information. The flight number is the most important piece of information and has been treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only branding is on the perforated line in between the stub and the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

This switch was hooked into the Input of my Arduino, and used to animate a basic LED circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of using standard LEDs, I decided to use a NeoPixel strip.“NeoPixel” is Adafruit’s brand for individually-addressable RGB (Red Green Blue) color pixels.  These strips make it easier to work with light and colours without needing to wire up a whole lot of individual LED’s to Arduino outputs manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/235098909&quot; width=&quot;800px&quot; height=&quot;500px&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Arduino reads the ‘on-off’ values from the spinners magnet switch.  When the magnet of the spinner makes contact with the switch it is processed in the Arduino as an ‘On state’. This pushes the program forward one step (propelling the LED spinner forward by one step) as long as the previous state read by the program was an ‘Off’. This prevents the program from remaining on continuously if the spinner stops while making contact with the magnet switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rainbow effect is created with the use of trigonometry functions. These functions, when applied to the number range used in RGB colours allow for us to rhythmically move through the colour spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I attempted to implement the ‘trails’ effect through the standard NeoPixel Arduino Library.  However, the library is poorly documented and made the process of getting the RGB values for a given light complicated. In the NeoPixel library, RGB brightness values are stored as long, single digit integers. Seeing as I was interested in working and blending colours individually, this format was not useful for me.   The C++ code to extract these separate RGB values from the long integer was very ugly and confused me so I decided to switch over to FastLED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FastLED has a far more simple API that seems to follow more modern programming patterns, and is maintained by an activate, open source community.  The documentation is clear and comprehensive. I would recommend to anyone wanting to do things with Arduino and LEDs.  It looks like they have some &lt;a href=&quot;http://fastled.io/docs/3.1/group___noise.html&quot;&gt;Noise Functions&lt;/a&gt; which I look forward to experimenting with in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One proposed real-world application for this experiment would be a modular lighting toy for Children. With a magnetized fidget spinner, you could have a series of LEDs that snap together to create basic LED artworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/bad5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sense was that there was something rather charming, and playful about the rainbow coloured branding and playful use of typography - however there was way too much information being presented, without hierarchy or sufficient design organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be fun to inject some more self awareness into their branding, and provide a poster that would maybe wink at itself a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/pachinko.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first attempted to recreate the style of the Pachinko’s Big Bet, which was a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/rainbow1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I abandoned this before finishing, as I was running up against limitations in my abilities with Illustrator and graphic design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next step was to try something less ambitious, and to work with some of the existing references. I noticed that there were 7 proposed remedies in the initial signs, and also 7 colours of the rainbow.   I proposed having these 7 remedies vanish with the rainbow. Instead of explaining ‘This is what we can help you with’,  I considered that it would be simpler and more direct to represent the 7 ailments  vanishing with the tail of the rainbow. The curving Rainbow typeface references the shape of the rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/rainbow%20body%20work.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Arial for the type face, and a basic Rainbow colour scheme. All very boring, but it is a start.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I decided to have a go at redesigning some of the signage and marketing that was put together by Rainbow Body Care in St. Marks Place.</summary></entry></feed>
